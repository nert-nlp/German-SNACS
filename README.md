# German-SNACS: A German Corpus Annotated for Adposition Semantics

Here you can find the annotated corpus described in ["Draw mir a Sheep: A Supersense-based Analysis of German Case and Adposition Semantics"](https://rdcu.be/cjY3P) by [Jakob Prange](https://prange.jakob.georgetown.domains/) and [Nathan Schneider](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/) (published in [KÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz](https://www.springer.com/journal/13218), volume 35: June 2021, issue 2).

Complete README coming soon! In the meantime, check out the English [STREUSLE corpus](https://github.com/nert-nlp/streusle), which is annotated with the same inventory of semantic categories (SNACS) and features a lot of helpful information and tools!
